## Project Description 

This project aims to compare several ideas in order to predict whether a person in an image is wearing a face mask. 
In a first part we try a simple CNN architecture. 
In a second part, we try to perform data augmentation by generating images using GANs. Furthermore, we do web scrapping to enlarge the dataset.
In this context, we compare two models : 
* A light one for fast training
* A large one built using transfer learning for high accuracy

Everything can be found in the jupyter notebook file.

## Data 

The data used in this project are initially coming from the [Spot the Mask Challenge ](https://zindi.africa/hackathons/spot-the-mask-challenge/data), Then we use web scrapped data and generated images.
